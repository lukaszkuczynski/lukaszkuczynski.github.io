My name is Luke.  I live in Poland.  I code for money.  It started around 8 yrs ago with some Delphi code written for electronic devices.  Then I switched to Java.  Finally I found job at place where I maintain several Java applications and provide root cause analysis but I find my joy in playing with data (ELK, Spark) and have fun with cloud computing.  The default language of choice is now Python, because I love its simplicity.  I hate repeatable work, so I like ideas of CI/CD and Docker.
